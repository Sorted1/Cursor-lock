# Cursor-lock
Roblox Cursor lock for UWP that automaticly detects roblox instance so you dont have to reopen script everytime.
## About

I made this script becuase I found that using [RBX-Cursor-Fix](https://github.com/mengdeveloper/microsoftrbx-cursor-fix) made me restart the script everytime I opened a new instance of roblox. So I decided to make a version of it in python that automaticly gets the HWND and will automaticly attach to roblox.
